Items needed for portfolio

About Myself

1.  A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.

- I'm a programming biomedical technician? Exploring software and fixing hardware? Developing software and equipment?

2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?

- Specialized work on advanced systems encompassing software and medical equipment.

3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

- Hi, my name is Rocio Martinez and I most recently worked as a biomedical technician in the Army. I left after completing my contract and I wanted to take advantage of the educational benefits. In the hospitals, medical equipment is mixing with technology so I thought it was important for me to be educated on both topics. In the future I hope to work on advanced medical systems like MRI an x-ray units. I have a top secret security clearance and an advanced certification in radiographic/fluoroscopic imaging systems, but I think my biggest asset is a solution seeking, critical thinking approach to any problem.

4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.

- Discovering the ways technology aids humans in the relm of medicine. There are a lot of different programs used in medical equipment for specific treatments like opthalmic, physical therapy, and diagnostics. It always amazes me how much the lives of others can be improved through treatment and technology!
